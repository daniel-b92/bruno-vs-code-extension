## About the package

This directory provides an `npm` package for a Typescript language service plugin, that allows the Typescript server to handle code blocks from `Bruno` files just like real Javascript code. See [online docs](https://docs.usebruno.com/) for more infos on `Bruno`. This npm package only aims at the open source parts of `Bruno`, see also [pricing](https://www.usebruno.com/pricing).

## Main Features

Only some of the intellisense features for `Bruno` files are provided by this npm package. For a fuller set of intellisense features, you can use the VS Code extension, that is built from the root folder of this git repository.
